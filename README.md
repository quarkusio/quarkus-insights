# Overview

Quarkus Insights is a [youtube live channel](https://youtube.com/quarkusio/live) that currently are hosted by Emmanuel, Max, Georgios and Jason

We use github issues with label "insights" to suggest and find ideas on future topics.

Go to [insights ideas issue list](https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus-insights/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Ainsights+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc) and vote-up or suggest new ideas.

We use this [project board](https://github.com/orgs/quarkusio/projects/8) for the immediate planning.

## Materials and requirements

- Browser (we use restream.io to stream and host guests, we will send you a link to connect to)
- Use light theme (not dark mode) as watching video on the go makes dark mode unreadable.
- Use wired Ethernet or very stable Wifi
- use headphones
- ideally, use a good microphone and make sure to select it as audio input 

## Participation

This section describes how participation in a Quarkus Insights episode works:

The format of the Quarkus video cast with a interviewee is as follows:

For Quarkus technology focused interview:
- deep dive (we want tech content and/or understanding of why)
- can mean long (1h) but might be shorter
- Emmanuel, Max, Jason and/or Georgios interviews you on a given subject

For Quarkus contributor/user focused interview:
- understanding of why and how - deep dive where it makes sense 
- can mean long (1h) but might be shorter
- Emmanuel and Max interviews you on your involvement and usage of Quarkus

The objective for the listener is:
- understand the technology or the usage
- see hands-on usage (live coding sessions)
- be ready to go use it in its app
- (optionally) get live questions answered

The objective for us:
- keep Quarkus users engaged
- disseminate technology not yet known to our listeners

Come prepared:
- we will discuss the skeleton of the interview
- if with a demo, come with that demo ready as we will pop in and out of code to show people how to use things

Structure of the interview:
- Who are you
- Technology X in 2 mins
- Some context into why it is useful for people
- Concretely how to use it
- Musing and conversations on various features during conversation/discussion
- under the cover: how are things done to make this happen
- More info

Otherwise
- Be confident in your technology to do a live demo
    - work it a bit so you are cutting to the essential bits
- Trust us it will be awesome
